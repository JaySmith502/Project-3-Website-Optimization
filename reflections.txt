Resources and Reflections on Udacity Nanodegree Cohort 1 Project 4
==================================================================

This was by far the most difficult and time-consuming project to date for the Nanodegree program.  Unlike previous projects, my previous knowledge of HTML and CSS wasn't very helpful in optimizing these
pages.  I did learn quite a bit as I was forced to revisit many resources, all of which are noted below.  I also was very fortunate to have the Piazza and Hipchat resources, I wouldn't have been able to
complete this project without the help of the Cohort.

I was able to quickly get all five webpages to above 90 on Page Speed Insights using the following methods:

1)	Inline css and remove reference to exterior style sheet.
2)	Optimizing images using tinypng.com and kraken.io.
	-I tried Smush.it as some on Piazza suggested but I found the interface less than ideal, probably just a personal taste matter.
3)	Adding height and width attributes to images as suggested by the PageSpeed Web App on my Chromebook.
4)	Moved all scripts and calls to footer, added async attributes.
5)      Extracted media queries from CSS file and added media = "print" to href calls.
6)      Minified source page files using http://willpeavey.com/minifier for html, http://cssminifier.com for css, and http://javascript-minifier.com for js files.
7)	Specific page optimizations:
	-Index.HTML
		Used @import call to maximize optimization of web font vs. importing font in header.
		created individual pizzeria-hp.jpg file to optimize size for home page rather than change sizes for home page vs. pizza.html.
	-Project-2048.html ("Build your own 2048!")
		No specific optimizations outside of those above.
	-Project-webperf.html ("Website Performance Optimization")
		No specific optimizations outside of those above.
	-Project-mobile.html
		No specific optimizations outside of those above.
	-Pizza.html
		No specific optimizations outside of those above (TO SPECIFICALLY GET TO >90 ON PAGESPEED INSIGHTS, FPS RENDERING DISCUSSED IN NEXT SECTION).

RESOURCES USED IN OPTIMIZING PIZZA.HTML TO ACHIEVE > 60 FPS USING THE TIMELINE IN DEVELOPER TOOLS

I was feeling pretty confident after quickly discerning how to achieve 90+ on Page Speed Insights, I actually thought it was rather easy and wasn't sure why people on Piazza who were ahead of me seemed to
be struggling with Project 4 and spending so much time discussing it and pointing to other resources.  I was soon to learn my arrogance was unfounded.  I'm estimating I spent about 85 hours on this particular project over the course of 4 weeks.  Here is a list of resources I used to help me get it to submission (in addition to those already noted above for Page Speed Insights).

This is not an exhaustive list, I also relied on help from other cohort 1 students on Piazza and HipChat as well as Google for finding the best image optimization tool among other logistical questions.
